# Retrofit

Retrofit app in which we have to implement the 'POST' type request. In this we are implementing sign up api. 
first we create sign up page design with 3 EditText name, 
email and password and one sign up Button. After that in our MainActivity we are getting our EditText and Button and on click of sign up Button 
the data in EditText is validated and then we are implementing signup api to save the data in our database. 
After getting response from api we are displaying the message on the screen by using a Toast.
